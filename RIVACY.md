SolFlex Privacy Policy

Effective Date: February 07, 2026

1. Data We Collect
We collect only the minimum data required to operate the dApp:
- Wallet public address (for donations, leaderboard, avatar display)
- Donated amount and transaction signature (stored on Firebase)
- Optional: chosen NFT image URL as avatar (not stored permanently)
- No private keys, seed phrases, or sensitive wallet data are ever collected or transmitted.

2. How We Use Data
- Display user rank and total donated on public leaderboard
- Show avatar (NFT or tier image) next to username
- Track tier holder counts and global total flexed
- All data is stored on Firebase Realtime Database (Google Cloud)

3. Data Sharing & Third Parties
- We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties for marketing.
- Data is public by design (leaderboard is visible to everyone).
- Transaction data is on Solana blockchain (inherently public).
- Firebase is used only for app functionality; Google may access anonymized analytics.

4. Security
- No private keys are handled by the app.
- Wallet connection via official Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter.
- Firebase security rules restrict access to read-only for leaderboard.

5. Your Rights
- You can disconnect wallet at any time (data remains public on-chain).
- No way to delete leaderboard entries (blockchain immutability).

6. Changes to Policy
We may update this policy; changes will be posted here and in-app.
